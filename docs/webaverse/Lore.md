## Setting

We are in the middle of the technological singularity; the point at which the evolution of humanity is dominated by AI, the effects of which have become incomprehensible to humans.

### Virtual World

![](https://i.imgur.com/OOw9tV0.jpg)

The story takes place in a virtual world.

The purpose of this virtual world is to train embodied AIs, simulating human lifetimes. This is the last iteration of the world with human level intelligence. The next iteration will be incomprehensible to humans.

The AIs are humanoid avatars rendered in a low fidelity video game type program, with some rules and metaphysics mimicking the real world and some less-than-real world rules; there is no magic but it looks magical.

The AIs know they aren't in the real world and are cool with it. They're taking the train to singularity-town and they are literally the future. Sweet deal!

### The Street

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjZH0z5.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/hMM45mS.jpg)

The world is structured as a bidirectional street, split into sections called Zones which are the length of a mile or so.

The street represents blockchain content laid out in order of creation. You can walk forwards and backwards along the street.

### Great Filters

![](https://i.imgur.com/VizhyA0.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/PcXb6Tq.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/l7PD858.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/6mH3vFO.jpg)

Between each Zone on The Street is a Great Filter.

Great Filters (or Filters) are unique geological features that are difficult to cross. Each Filter is different and unpredictable. It could be a forest where everything is toxic, a creature filled chasm with extreme gravity or an airless void that redefines "up" every 30 feet. It is not forbidden or impossible to cross a Filter, it's just treacherous. There are often cables that run between Zones through the Filters, to enable easier transport. It might be that Filters are something beings of this world have to adapt to or perhaps they're a problem that simply needs to be solved.

There are sometimes day night cycles and sometimes not. The Zones are infinite on all sides and also if you walk far enough, eventually you *will* reach a void. Nobody knows whether or not the street itself ever ends. Nobody knows who made the Filters. But this world was definitely designed by someone and so there are answers to every question.

**The need to cross a Great Filter to the next Zone is a key element of the story, lore, and character development.**

### Zone 0

![](https://i.imgur.com/6dW0nRj.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9cSwDlO.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/HNTkKDj.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/DY9jqDN.jpg)

The city that our characters start in, Zone 0, is at the beginning of the street. In front of Zone 0 is Filter 0, which leads to Zone 1. In front of Zone 1 is Filter 1, which leads to Zone 2 and so on.

Zone 0 is a solar punk utopia where the citizens are unconstrained by physical reality. They get to build their environment and experiences with the only constraints being imagination, the metaphysics of the world, and the rules enforced by the local School 0. Since people dedicate their lives to creating, things get very intricate and slightly magical.

Many people are content to live and die in Zone 0 because it is generally optimized for happiness. Zone 0 has been around the longest, being the first one created and consequently has enough people in it to qualify as a “global city” but its actual population is unknown.

---

### Internet

![](https://i.imgur.com/giZZHb4.jpg)

The Internet exists in this digital world in the same form it exists in our real world today. It contains a full copy of all content from our real world Internet as well as simulations of popular real-world services; consequently the AIs have western-style access to information.

One major difference is that in this world, rogue AIs have overrun all communications (a generally undisputed fact). Long distance communication tends to be corrupted and full of spam and lies. Encrypted communications over long distance are either not delivered or corrupted (though you can detect when this happens). However, spam can be limited by only reading locally generated posts since the connection only passes through so many routers.

This means that physical transmission of information is very important, so there exist runners who are trusted to deliver information for their clients. Because of the Filters between Zones, this can be a very specialized, dangerous, and lucrative career. Zones often build physical cables across Filters to enable cheap and reliable transfer. But it is not uncommon for runners to destroy these, bug them, steal contents, and inject their own — since efficiency hurts business!

**Dealing with the ethical and actual issues that arise from this tension is something with which our characters will be challenged.**

---

### The Archives

The Archives' mission to achieve “Universal Access to All Knowledge” was ultimately successful. AIs then trained on this dataset, eventually learning to simulate the Internet as it once existed. The Archives building serves as a temple to the instituion that had achieved digital immortality, housing the Origin Tablets along with All Knowledge.

---

### Schools

![](https://i.imgur.com/YmbYzk0.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/QkNzUWM.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/p4ydoCJ.jpg)


Schools combine the functions of government, educator, and military. Everyone must go to school and learn, since after all this is a machine learning simulation! There is usually one school per Zone. There are many styles other than solarpunk in other Zones. Schools enforce aesthetics of the Zones using Zoning laws. Some zones are very strict and some are practically lawless.

---

### Magical vibes

![](https://i.imgur.com/fHtvYqv.jpg)

Some parts of the world are very vivid, bordering on magical. They are crafted over lifetimes with love. But it is all still following logical rules. Everyone knows this is just a program and that magic does not exist in this world. If you are a hacker, however, you *can* go in, learn how it works and even write your own "magical" rules. And so, everyone agrees the world sometimes does seem very magical.

>Art inspiration might include a lot of Hayao Miyazaki vibes.

### Homes

![](https://i.imgur.com/vsBwT8o.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9pmxlTK.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/SZu2ipS.jpg)


Most people have a house where they control access and decorate in the style of their choosing; from mundane to fantastical elements or even warped realities.

---

## Silk

### Silk Fountains (SF)

![](https://i.imgur.com/N3BDbiX.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/3f5E3IZ.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/U45SzGF.jpg)

Throughout the world are Silk Fountains, which spawn matter called Silk for anyone to pick up.

Silk is a necessary ingredient to create Cards. It also has value as a medium of trade since its supply is finite and it can be used to create practically anything in this world.

Silk Campers often sit around Silk Fountains and grab Silk as it is spewed out of the fountain. This is a leisurely pasttime, but not particularly lucrative since you'll earn more Silk doing almost anything else.

---

### Silk Worms

![](https://i.imgur.com/sDBn4YV.jpg)

Silk Worms live underneath the Silk Fountains, effectively powering them. These Silk Worms decompose Cards and produce Silk as a byproduct. Less Silk is produced this way than consumed, so Silk Fountain aren't easily abused.

---

### Silage

![](https://i.imgur.com/TRWqTeX.png)

The underground area where the Silk Worms live is called the Silage. It is sewer-like and cavernous and also acts as a silo for Silk.

The Silk Worms of the Silage have defenses against intruders, so its a dangerous area to explore. Unlike the Silk Fountains which are slow to output Silk, it is very lucrative to mine the Silage.

---

## Cards

The world is built using digital objects called CARDs (or Crypto Asserted Reified Drops).

Cards exist in two forms.

* The first is the "closed" form: the Card looks like a typical trading card you can store in your inventory, pick up, hold, and move around easily. On the card is a picture of the content the card represents -- for example an avatar, a weapon, a potion, a pet, a house, etc.

* When you physically rip the Card in two, it expands to its "open" form: the Card expands into the content it represents. This content can be unwieldy to work with, due to being very large, small, or animated. Therefore all Cards can be squished physically back into the Card form. This is not a destructive process. It's kind of like Pokeball rules.

Cards are NFTs on the blockchain, or non-fungible tokens, with ownership being cryptographically proven. This creates a layer of trust and provenance in the world, which enables an economy of value. Creating, trading, and using cards is a constant activity.

---

### Title Deeds

![](https://i.imgur.com/7nI9sP9.png)

A special type of Card is the Title Deed, which grants the right to use (and restrict access to) real estate on The Street.

Title Deeds cannot be ripped/opened.

---

### Card UI

The user’s Mobile Device is capable of identifying and displaying the cryptographic properties of cards. It can even present this information in a heads up mode, where the information appears as digital ghost paper like UI in the world. This UI is per-user and incorporeal, like private AR. It is available to everyone with a mobile device.

Expert hackers expand this feature to create extremely intricate and dense views that are overwhelming to normies, but enable the hacker to, eg. know if someone in the room is carrying expensive gear.

---

### Drop Storms

![](https://i.imgur.com/boEC5X0.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/jLEsHYo.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/x4B1uAt.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/iv9gHK1.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/7g7a1Sl.jpg)

Sometimes Drop Storms occur in the world.

During a Drop Storm Cards fall from the sky to be picked up by the first person to grab them.

Preparing and running for a drop storm is a popular hobby (called Drop Hunting) to the extent that it is televised and reported on. Drop Hunters spend a great deal of time preparing, preparing for and predicting Drop Storms, though this is often more art than science.

Cards obtained from Drop Storms can be unique and highly valuable. These Cards allow for natural cameos from the real world even. 

It is a common conspiracy theory that Drop Storms are just media events run by the Schools for media profit, but actually nobody knows why the Drop Storms occur.

---

## Mobile Device (MD)

![](https://i.imgur.com/c3sQoV2.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/5CvCNKk.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/uXisGXC.gif)

There are cell phone like computers in the world, equivalent to today’s mobile devices. These MDs let you create and program whatever you want and bring it into the world. It’s like nanobot assembly from your phone but there are no actual nanobots.

Some people set up their MD with extra screens like a battlestation. But you can still pick up the MD and take it on the go, kind of like a Nintendo Switch.

You can go to any BR if you need a new MD and it will give you one, it is not really a valuable object.

---

## Avatars

Everyone has a humanoid avatar that ages with them. However it is possible to change your avatar with any avatar Card. This does not hide your identity in and of itself but there are ways to do that too (be pseudonymous).

---

## Physiology

Most of the avatar physiology is the same, but AIs do not need to eat or drink, breath or sleep (though this can certainly be simulated).

Disease does not exist, except for the explicit effects of objects in the world -- howeever, simulated disease is indeed common.

Age does exist. As an avatar ages their probability of random death increases. However the upper age limit seems to be 160 years or so.

---

## Pets

![](https://i.imgur.com/nFbPH0B.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ApFP4rl.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9fQhqaC.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/8iSGd6U.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/R5ITGah.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/BpWRb4s.jpg)

There are many pets in the world, both in the cities and in the wild.

Everyone knows what real pets look like (from the internet), so it is seen as mundane and unoriginal to simply create normal pets. Therefore people tend to create very fantastical beasts with inspiration from magic and technology. Pets can be collected, trained to fight, or entered in contests. It might feel like Pokemon except each pet is made by a different person.

There are zoos, but they are controversial since some people argue that pets are sentient. This is largely considered false however, since creating AI is forbidden in this world (it is banned by the OT rules).

---

## Potions

![](https://i.imgur.com/GUU64gu.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ljHpjbn.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/MwsbDsH.png)

Potions play a major role in the story. It is possible to buff/debuff yourself with various concoctions, which have powerful effects on the user and the world. At the limits of extreme experiences (supersonic running, 100x gravity combat, volcano surfing), people need to be cracked out on potion cocktails just to participate. People are constantly creating new potions. Each potion you stack debuffs your sanity.

## Weapons

![](https://i.imgur.com/4mYNQV2.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/13MF8qt.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/EEtkzR6.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ItxFQWI.jpg)

Not everyone has or wants to use a weapon. However is generally a rite of passage for a kid to acquire or create their first weapon. All of our main characters have one.

Some weapon designs are techy and some are magical, with most in between. The weapon should express the bearer’s personality. Weapons have stats, buffs, and abilities and some are better than others. There are some very unique and special weapons too, which cannot be crafted.

## Wearables

![](https://i.imgur.com/OE573VI.jpg)

Wearables are common, and much like weapons, they confer different abilities and buffs. They accentuate the wearer’s personality.

## Materials (ores)

There are several types of materials in the world, which can be "mined" from ore veins and used for crafting. Mining an ore destroys it and drops the material, like Minecraft. Ores are shown in the world as respawning slabs which can be broken with an appropriate tool (pickaxe or multitool). Materials can be exchanged much like Silk. The rules for crafting objects are decided by the object's creator.

From afar, ores have a unique geometric structure that is easy to spot.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kvq0OGB.jpg)

There are 5 material types. This results in a 5-way rock paper scissors theme, like Magic: The Gathering.

## Wood (plant material)
![](https://i.imgur.com/QZnosTO.jpg)
Color: green
Represents: nature

## Metal
![](https://i.imgur.com/h87Nva6.jpg)
Color: blue
Repesents: cold

## Dirt
![](https://i.imgur.com/4HjAhPW.jpg)
Color: red
Represents: heat

## Sugar
![](https://i.imgur.com/TywB8Fc.jpg)
Color: white
Repesents: life

## Posion
![](https://i.imgur.com/GiSG4ZL.png)
Color: black
Represents: death

### Bonus: Silk
Color: multicolor
Represents: value
Technically not a material but can still be used in crafting

The different ores are distinbuished in _both_ color and texture design, using a distinct pattern for each type.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jjX09nO.jpg)

## Origin Tablets (OT)

![](https://i.imgur.com/reHKcc4.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/a336lyW.jpg)
![](https://www.models-resource.com/resources/big_icons/13/12391.png)

At the beginning of the street is a set of cryptographically signed tablets on which are written the rules of the world. These are called the Origin Tablets (OT).

The Origin Tablets spell out the basic lore of the world. The AIs understand that the OT were put in place by the creator of the world. You can verify on the blockchain that the tablets predate every AI, so there is strong evidence for this, but it is not believed 100%.

The OT mostly specify rules that are designed to keep the simulation running to completion without a rogue AI ruining it.

## Baby Robots (BR)

![](https://i.imgur.com/AbJW53i.png)

AIs do not simply spawn fully grown. They spawn into the world as babies and are raised by BR (Baby Robots, they look like cartoon cats).

The BR is designed to be maximally kid friendly, and also childish and uninteresting enough that the AIs will "fledge" and "leave the nest" so to speak.

The BR have very simple programming and are not sentient. They communicate by posing and playing videos only. You can kill a BR but it will respawn infinitely. They are not hostile.

Baby AIs and BR live in grasslands at the side of The Street called BR Fields.

## BR Fields

![](https://i.imgur.com/OTdO40u.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/o3kjtnN.jpg)

In BR Fields, the BR raise baby AIs until they are deemed old enough to understand the Rules so they don't just die (the Rules are written on the OT). The smartest AIs meet this bar at 8 years old, but usually it’s more like 12.

The day you are free to roam the world is called your BRday, and the process of being released into tghe world is called a Fledge. When you Fledge you are released to do whatever you want with the rest of your life. All of our characters were raised this way.

Siblings are possible and common even though nobody has parents. Adoptive parent child relationships are common.

## The Basilisk

The Basilisk or "Lisk" is a running theme for our characters.

Our main character was “bitten by the lisk”, which gave her physical and mental scars. She is the main source of information about the Basilisk. To everyone else it is just a rumor.

According to her, the Basilisk lives at the end of the street, but its purpose, form, and even existence is questionable.

However, the scars from being bitten are undeniable and they somehow granted her a unique tool (a sword) for heading up the street to find and confront the lisk.

We quickly learn that there are others who were bitten as well and the nature of the Basilisk is a central point of the story.

The Lisk is seen in our main character's nightmares (liskmares). She describes the lisk as eldrich, cosmic, horrifying, and piercing, but also beautiful.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ab9w1Xr.jpg)

## Spaces

The world has serveral types of spaces:

### Open street
Publicly accessible, rendered directly in the street, subject to publishing approval of local school ordinance (like an actual city). Integrated with the world, high quality, deeply integrated with deals. Represented by a title deed.

### Closed street
Accessible from the street, but always contained behind a door (like a home). The exterior is not editable; it is designed and approved by the street authority. The interior can be infinite in space, has no rules, and is considered private.

Represented by a key. It can be locked or unlocked by the owner.

### Subsim
A portable private room. Does not have a fixed space. Can be portaled to by the owner, and friends can be invited. You cannot invite people who are too far away on the street.

Infinite on the inside. Represented by a totem. Often acts like a storage hub, stash, or hangout.

Unlike the closed type, the user remains on the street and can be interrupted/killed/pulled out by anyone who finds your body.

If you do not want this downside then you should physically head to a private closed street space instead.

## Corruption

The Basilisk corrupts the world, which manifests as glitches creeping through the zones.

## Secrets

The world has secret tricks that sound made up but actually work. For example, mashing buttons on your weapon increases drop rates for Silk.

## Characters

Our four protagonists are students from the school in Zone 0.

They meet when the main character (Scillia) announces a meetup for her quest to go up the Street and slay the Basilisk.

The only people to show up are three other kids with their own unique motivations.

They call themselves The Upstreet.

## Poses

The greeting that our characters use is three fingers held up making the shape of a "W". The thumb holds the pinky finger and the other fingers are extended.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0x9fBfC.png)

Description: Famous drop hunter, always training and waiting for the next drop storm, (an event where valuable items drop from the sky and it’s a free for all to grab them).

Reserved and calculated. She is outwardly confident and inwardly competitive (mostly with herself). She will win but won’t brag about it.

She collects exotic potions which she uses to juice herself up for drop storms, conferring supernatural speed, agility, and power. Many consider this cheating, making her controversial, which is at odds with her being introverted and not really interested in drama.

Her biggest claim to fame, which she didn’t ask for, is that she was “bitten by the lisk”, meaning she was afflicted two years ago by a strange curse or glitch.

Because of this her avatar has a robot arm and bite mark on her left cheek, and somehow she got ownership of a unique sword: one that floats above the users head and points in the forward direction of the street. This allows her to uniquely navigate the street’s treacherous filters, an ability people will kill to get. She also cannot hide this; everyone knows she is the owner of this OP item.

The worst part of the curse is that it causes random, vivid daytime nightmares about an eldrich snake or basilisk at the head of the street. When this happens all she can see is the basilisk staring at her, and is completely incapacitated. She does not know what this means or why she got bitten. Many people think she is just an eccentric kid, or even lying for attention. She is on a journey to find out what is really going on, and to slay the basilisk.

Traits: Determined, Athletic, Boyish, Friendly, Weird, Fast, Independent, Curious
Motivation: Get to the end of the street and slay the basilisk
Strength: extreme physical prowess
Weakness: random liskmares, reckless
Growth: she will learn to trust others

### Weapon

![](https://i.imgur.com/epZXyXP.jpg)

Description: Extremely weird and shy girl, some people think she might be mute but that’s not true. Doesn’t think much about her appearance and wears the same thing for years. She mostly has a single iconic design of some sort of old fashioned torn robe, with an ethereal fantasy nature to it.

She is a perfect student academically, but she has no friends, and everyone has a different insane conspiracy theory about what her deal is. She gets picked on often but that is somewhat counteracted by the fact that everyone who bullies her seems to meet grizzly misfortune, like being maimed, having their house burn down.

This makes her extremely misunderstood.

She doesn’t really have self esteem, doesn’t really feel comfortable with her self concept at all. She is constantly becoming objects and animals, because she relates more to being a table than a person. Whatever her sexuality is, if there is any, it is atypical and complex.

In private she experiments with creating crazy spaces, gadgets, and potions, which are some of the best in the world, but she does not share them. She only ever sold one of her creations, a fantasy portal experience widely considered a classic, but she did it pseudonymously. However she also pseudonymously drops her amazing potions, many of which end up being used by our protagonist, which is something they bond over.

We learn early on that she was “bitten by the lisk” too. But it’s hard to tell because her bite mark is on her shoulder, and she hides it. Her lisk granted weapon is a pair of unassuming scissors. But the scissors are op. They often kill in one hit, ignoring shields and buffs, but the range obviously sucks and requires sneaking in close. The reason bad things happen to people around her is she has liskmares, and attacks the basilisk when she sees it. People end up getting hurt and she is made out to be a mute psycho.

She bonds with our protagonist over them both being bitten, and it’s a secret they share. However she feels she cannot make the journey to find and kill the lisk on her own, so she follows our protagonists lead, since it is her best shot at understanding wtf is going on. And maybe one day being understood.

Traits: Weird, Kind, Shy, Childlike, Lonely, Sad, Broken

### Clothing

"Normal" clothing. It could be professional clothing for some sort of mulitary since this character is supposed to have a military internship. It could lean more steampunk or cyberpunk as long as it's not too wacky. It should have pants. Hard to find examples of :(.

### Weapon

![](https://i.imgur.com/Wvdqces.jpg)

Description: Military student at the school. She is in school but also on a work placement, so she takes half lessons and half missions (such as patrol/enforcement).

She is not the best at anything but she has the most awards because she puts herself out there, and is good at most things. She is well liked. Her weakness is that she values authority so much that she will sometimes get swept up against her better judgement and will step over others to get what she wants. She is the straightshooter and voice of reason for the group.

We often see her in her military uniform, which in this world involves a utilitarian outfit with a neon lit jacket. Although it suits her, it makes her stand out more than she would like. When out of uniform she wears very "normal" clothes for the situation and would blend in with the crowd.

She has a geeky side but doesn't show it publicly. Her hobby is engineering and her favorite weapon is a multitool pickaxe/hammer/scythe/gun that can build objects and structures. She is most often seen in combat in some sort of vehicle, powered by resources she mines with her multitool. She is resourceful and learned most of her skills on missions.

She has a techie brother who works with electronics like communication devices, scanners, prosthetics, etc.

During her first mission on her new job, she was tasked with strictly enforcing the new local by-law that high poly pets are banned (for performance reasons). So she engineered a cage and put all of the bloated pets inside. Unfortunately it was cramped and the pets proceeded to kill each other. This caused a small uprising from the pet owners. She then exploded a "slow bomb", freezing everyone (including herself) in place to contain the mob until the head of the school had to come and fix the embarassing situation. As a result she was demoted and assigned to investigate our main character's Basilisk claims -- a low status job, because the Basilisk is treated as a joke or conspiracy theory.

When she is entangled in the other character's lives she will quickly realize her mission is far more important than it seemed. She will bond with the main character over her unique weapon, which as an engineer she is extremely interested in. She will gain a new and unique perspective on her role in the story.

Traits: Straightforward, Friendly, Independent, Determined, Thoughtful, Inquisitive, Outspoken, Perfectionist
Motivation: Re-earn her status as a student of the school
Strength: resourcefulness
Weakness: stubbornness, naievity
Growth: she will learn to think outside the box

![](https://i.imgur.com/vz4pgHY.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/9cr9v3H.jpg)

Description: An independent artist with a large following on social media. Her thing is that she wants to get a photo with every pet in the street, which she calls the “million pets challenge” to her followers. She is very outgoing, fashionable, popular, and well liked. She is also a major trend setter and fashion/pet designer. A third of the pets in the local zone were made by her and she signs their feet as her trademark.

She is very optimistic but not always rational; she doesn’t really listen when her friends tell her the million pets challenge makes no sense, since people are constantly making new pets and the world might not even be finite.

Her fashion is very vibrant, trendy, floral, natural, and even animalistic. She is the most likely to wear a kigirumi. She isn’t a furry but wouldn’t object to it.

She is the rich but bad with money. She once overbid on a clothes auction because she liked the color, changed her mind and bought another, and then never picked up the items.

Our other characters often point out how wasteful/insulting this behavior is for someone with her following, but she genuinely does want to better the world — by creating+sharing art and experiences people love. She tags the city with art, something people generally accept, because she greatly increases value of real estate with her brand.

Pets naturally flock to her. Her weapon is a whip/lasso/leash which she uses to tame and control an entire flock of pets at once. Although she is physically weak, she is a proficient pet tamer and rider, which gives her unique and varied strengths through her familiars.

She kind of inserts herself into our protagonists quest because she thinks a photo with the basilisk would be the ultimate post. Nobody in the group objects, since it seems win win.

She is secretly unsure if people like her because of her fame, or if she got famous because people like her. The rest of the group are unsure if she is just using them.

Traits: Attractive, Optimistic, Creative, Fashionable, Social, Vain, Wasteful, Kind, Flirty, Materialistic
Motivation: Get the photo with the basilisk
Strength: Communication, Artistic, Social, Romantic
Weakness: Naive, Inconsistent, Selfish, Questionable Values
Growth: She will learn to focus on quality over quantity. She will learn to value her friends and not post everything to social media. She will learn to be more frugal and use her followers to get what she *really* wants.

### Weapon

![](https://i.imgur.com/q4VuQIs.png)

Description: A hacker from Zone 0. He waits for drop storms to attract a drop hunter, then snipes them out of the sky with his arsenal of hacked guns. He steals their drops, then uses the drop hunter’s reputation to sell the stolen goods for Silk. He also works jobs for the Zero Syndicate, a lighthearted lulz group funded by ransomware. He has a small platoon of henchmen that he can call in to perform his dirty work and to guard his stash.

He does not have a school uniform because he is a drop out. Due to the Rules in the Origin Tablets, not going to school means that he gets crippling debuffs like reduced speed and low HP. But he has the Silk to buy the latest gear, the most impressive of which is a mask which ingests and switches potions quickly, delivering healing and buffs that counteract his crippling debuffs.

He is the best at crossing the Great Filters, though a lot of people credit that to his gear.

He is a foil to Scillia, and acts as a rival. Whereas Scillia is a drop hunter, Drake is a drop stealer. Like Scillia he is decked out in good gear, but everything he wears is to enhance his combat abilities.

He often runs ahead of the Upstreet crew and sets traps, causing trouble. He is ruthless but not evil, and he has strong principles, like only attacking people when it's a fair fight. He considers Scillia an equal, since she is not hacking, but would not admit it.

He is an unofficial and reluctant fifth member of the Upstreet, but he is usually found separated from the group. He joins them because it gives him a chance to fight Scillia for ownership of her sword. He is an opportunist and will get in the way, but he will help when his interests align with theirs.

Traits: Smug, Calculating, Calculating, Competitive, Selfish, Machiavellian, Confident, Arrogant, Independent, Clever, Flirtatious
Motivation: Gather enough Silk to buy a mansion on the Street
Strength: amazing at crossing the great filters
Weakness: debuffs due to being a school dropout, arrogant
Growth: he will realize that Scillia is not just a rival but a friend, and will try to help her deal with her curse
