Webaverse is an open source virtual world built on principles of enabling true digital ownership, an open economy, and interoperability. There's several parts:

- Tools to create and monetize content
- Custom avatars + multiplayer + VR support
- Discovery of amazing experiences across the Internet

The virtual world is organized around one main street, like a web page that goes forwards and backwards instead of up and down. It's also a metaphor for a blockchain, in which The Street is the ever expanding chain connecting the blocks that contributors help shape throughout time.

The Street is a curated quality experience, coordinated in artistic direction per season theme. Along The Street are various areas of land that users can own and control called [parcels](/docs/webaverse/parcels), which can be linked to full experiences within or outside the platform.
